### A simple script that gives you well over 100 years of Crossover Trial Version. Should be plenty enough for you and your kids :)

#### To run the script:
    1. Make sure Crossover is installed
    2. Download main.py
    3. Open a terminal
    4. CD into your download folder
    5. Run the script by typing: python3 main.py
  
  You're all set, just fire up Crossover and you should have A LOT of days remaining.
